###### for IB DP CS with S. Wegscheid

If you are enrolled in this course, you are probably already pretty well aware of what I teach, and the style my courses typically take. This will be a somewhat new adventure though, as I've never had a test in Tech to prep students for. As such, there may be chunks that have to run differently, and you will have to do some stuff outside of class. Majority of my Design and Tech courses at WAIS are designed with regards to IB MYP and CP. Courses also fulfill Texas STEM or Business & Industry graduation endorsements if part of a coherent sequence.

As we move through the year, there are topics we must cover, an additional topic selected between 4 options, cover a programming language, and design a program for a client, documenting and recording how it operates. We will work with Javascript and cover the additional topic of modeling and simulation. One of the options to cover is the web. You can study this more on your own, or use an elective slot (if you still have one) to take web design which will cover all the needed material for this option (and more), and work with the same languages. On the IB exams themselves, you only get to choose one option, but this would give you knowledge in two of the options, and allow you to decide which you think you'd do better on.

Not all classes are available every year. The courses taught are based on the interest level shown on course selection sheets. There are some years where Web Design doesn't make. If you intend to take it next year, you may want to convince friends and other people to take it to to ensure there's enough.

### Classroom Expectations:
The Balcony Mac Lab is a district computer lab, and as such has some policies that are set by the district.

By the district, food and drink are not allowed. This includes candy and gum. Students may have a water bottle, but it needs to be resealable, and kept on the floor.

Every student is sitting at a new iMac with 16 gb of ram and a 21.5” screen. As such, students do not need and should not be using any additional devices without permission. This includes but is not limited to phones, tablets, and chrome books.

In most my courses, specific homework is rarely given. This class has specific content we must cover from IB though, so we'll see how exactly that plays out. I am assuming we will have to have regular homework to move through and practice the content for retention of the important aspects.

### For class, please consider bringing:
* Headphones (your personal use)
* Jacket/Sweater (if you get cold easy)

Please consider bringing some form of supplies for general class use, such as:
* Kleenex
* Graph Paper
* Printer Paper

### Course Content:
Students will work with professional software and languages in design and tech courses. The specific software will vary depending on the course.

When turning in work, use font in a responsible readable manner; around sizes 10-12, good contrast in colors, respectable serif or san serif fonts like Avenir, Helvetica, Georgia, Palatino, Times, etc. Any work in Comic Sans, Papyrus, Curlz, or other overly decorative fonts will not be scored. A document should not have more than 2 or 3 fonts. If variety is needed, make use weight, sizes, and styles within the same font instead of hopping from font to font.

### Major Reports and Projects:
Courses will have documentation accompanying long term project work. These projects and documents are due at the end of each semester, and students will work on different parts of them throughout the course.

This is aligned and modeled from industry and is aligned with IB Design expectations.

### Grading:
Design and Tech places a higher grade percentages on what you do everyday, as opposed to on just a single day when you might have a test or project due.

| %                 | Category                            | 
| ------------------| ----------------------------------- |
| 50%               | * Daily / Activities                |
| 30%               | * Projects / Tests                  |
| 20%               | * Homework / Quizzes / Out of Class |

If there is a question regarding grades in any of your classes, please speak to your teacher sooner than later. There are limitations to when changes can be made. If a grade should be changed, and it isn't because you chose not to talk to me about it, it won't be changed.

### Cheating & Academic Dishonesty
##### Copyright & Intellectual Property:
All forms of academic dishonesty and cheating are taken seriously. Some forms of cheating and academic dishonesty are more self-explanatory than others. When it comes to art, many students struggle with understanding intellectual property. As such, it is generally recommended to avoid using copyrighted materials without first discussing it with your instructor.
 
Many students are under the belief that if it is for education, copyright and intellectual property laws don't apply. This is not the case. Many companies choose not to file charges when copyright or intellectual property laws are violated for educational use; some companies do, and this doesn't mean they can't choose to at a later point in time. Use of others' works within your own work, without proper documentation can result in loss of credit. However, use of copyrighted material can also result in legal issues in addition to any academic woes.

##### Collaboration vs Collusion:
All forms of academic dishonesty and cheating are taken seriously. Some forms of cheating and academic dishonesty are more self-explanatory than others. The form of academic dishonesty that seems to confuse students is collusion. Collusion is providing or receiving unauthorized aid or assistance. What is or isn't authorized can vary from course to course, so it is important that you communicate with, and understand the expectations of, your instructor.
 
Research, as well as personal experience, shows that students tend to understand content better when working with and discussing content with other students. Some assignments will actually require it. However, it is important that the aid and assistance you receive, or that you provide, is authorized. If you are physically touching another student's keyboard, mouse, or sending complete or partial chunks of an assignment, you are likely engaging in collusion, not collaboration. If unsure, it's better to ask. Collusion is a form of academic dishonesty and can result in loss of credit for all parties involved.
