Before you could even respond, you were whacked across the head with an invisible hammer. From there, the four mute clowns promptly carried you by your legs and shoulders into their invisible van and drove visibly away."

You can see the outside world, but after standing up and feeling something hard slam against your head and a metallic reverb, you soon realize that the mute assailants had placed you in a make-shift cage: an invisible box."

He fakes a giggle, bringing out from behind his back something that requires being held with both hands. He holds the invisible weapon in front of him, maniacally not-laughing and tugging what seems to be an invisible handle, pulling it towards the sky as though it were connected to a string."

    no_pantomime = "As the mime swings his mime chainsaw at the invisible box, you are met with a sudden sharp pain inside your chest. You clutch your weak heart, and fall to the ground, succumbing to the unimaginable depths of fear. Thankfully it wasn't a gorey death like your mind was probably leading it to, but you meet a pathetic demise that could have been avoided. If only you had used your potential power of pantomiming and imagination..."
