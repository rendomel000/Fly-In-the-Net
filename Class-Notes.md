**1. Ada Lovelace**  
*•Born on December 10th, 1815 in London, United Kingdom. Died on November 27th, 1852.*  
•Ada Lovelace is often known as the first woman to introduce the idea of programming in history, her influence dating all the way back to 1843. After meeting Charles Babbage, she and him began to plan out a type of machine. This invention would be known as the "Analytical Engine"; it was designed to calculate a language of its' own, composed entirely of algebraic and mathematical questions (written off on punched cards) in order to process commands. Ada Lovelace was most remembered for providing the information through annotations of other scholars' interpretations. She also helped to provide the language. Her reputation is often celebrated as a symbol of women in the STEM field.   
**2. Charles Babbage**  
*•Born on December 26th, 1791 in London, United Kingdom. Died on October 18th, 1871.*  
•Charles Babbage is the man who worked with Ada Lovelace on designing the machine, the "Analytical Engine". Being known as the first computer, the invention was planned to calculate a language of its' own. The language would consist of mathematical questions written off on punched cards, serving as an input for the engine to solve; in response, the computer would take the commands to produce an answer, and output it to the user. Ada Lovelace helped in providing the base for the language.
